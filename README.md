# Numerical Methods with Scilab

This repository contains Scilab scripts developed as part of the "Numerical Methods" course during my second year of university. The project showcases various numerical techniques applied to mathematical problems using Scilab, a high-level numerical computation platform.

## 📚 About the Project

Throughout this project, I explored and implemented a variety of numerical methods commonly used in scientific computing and engineering. The scripts reflect both theoretical understanding and practical application of numerical problem-solving techniques.

Topics covered include:

- 📌 Solving nonlinear equations (e.g., Bisection method, Newton-Raphson)
- 📌 Polynomial approximation and interpolation
- 📌 Solving systems of linear equations (e.g., Gaussian elimination)
- 📌 Iterative methods (e.g., Jacobi and Gauss-Seidel methods)
- 📌 Numerical differentiation and integration
- 📌 Solving ordinary differential equations (ODEs)

Each `.sce` file in this repository corresponds to a different topic or assignment covered during the course.
